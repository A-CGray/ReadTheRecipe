Gnocchi with Brussel Sprouts, Garlic, and a shit-load of butter
===============================================================

Details
-------

* Number of servings: 6
* Cook time: 20 minutes

Ingredients
-----------

* 1 lb Brussel sprouts, trimmed and halved so they have a big flat face
* 500g gnocchi (or any type of pasta)
* At least 4 cloves of garlic (prefferably more), finely minced
* The juice and zest of 1 lemon (zest less important than juice)
* 6 tbsp butter
* Chilli flakes

Optional:
* Parmesan
* 1/2 tsp honey

Equipment
---------

* A saucepan for cooking the gnocchi/pasta
* The widest frying pan you have, prefferably with high sides
* A strainer

Steps
-----

1. Put salted water on to boil
2. Put a decent covering of olive oil in the frying pan, and place the sprouts in it, flat-side down.
3. Scatter lemon-zest on top, put the heat on medium high, cover the pan with a lid and cook for 3-5 minutes, until the sprouts are browned and are soft, remove from pan.
4. Put the gnocchi in the boiling water, for 2-3 minutes, just until they float, then drain.
5. Add the drained gnocchi to the frying pan (you may need to add a little more oil) and cook for 2-3 minutes, until they start to crisp up.
6. Add back in the sprouts, along with the garlic, chilli flakes, butter, salt and pepper, cook until the butter starts to brown.
7. Add the lemon juice, honey if using, and a splash of pasta water, stir everything up to combine, and serve with parmesan.

Notes
-----

If using pasta instead of gnocchi, skip the gnocchi browning step (unless you like crispy pasta). You'll probably also want to put the pasta on before you start the sprouts for the timing to work out.
